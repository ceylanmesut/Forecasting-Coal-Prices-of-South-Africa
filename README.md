# Time Series Forecasting of Coal Prices in South Africa between 2016-2020
Forecasting plays an important role in various fields of the concern. With the help of forecasting, the enterprises can find out whether they can succeed in the new business; whether they can face the existing competition. In this project and its paper, we describe the analysis and importance of time series forecasting by taking the example of the coal prices of South Africa. We perform extensive data analysis of time series and feature selection before training the classical ARIMA model, machine learning based XGBoost model and deep learning based LSTM model. We prove that selecting better features help in increasing modelâ€™s performance. We also perform large-scale hyperparameter search using TALOS and report the results and compare all the models. We found that our XGBoost model outperforms ARIMA and LSTM model with an R2 score of 0.91 as compared to R2 0.83 of LSTM model and R2 0.71 of ARIMA model.
